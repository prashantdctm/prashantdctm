Mar 9, 2012 12:38:32 PM org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader clearThreadLocalMap SEVERE: The web application [/assetlibrary] created a ThreadLocal with key of type [java.lang.ThreadLocal] (value [java.lang.ThreadLocal@58d63b5b]) and a value of type [com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.property.SingleElementNodeProperty] (value [com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.property.SingleElementNodeProperty@58d300ed]) but failed to remove it when the web application was stopped. This is very likely to create a memory leak.
